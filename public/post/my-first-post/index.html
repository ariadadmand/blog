		<h1><a href="http://ariadadmand.github.io/post/my-first-post/">First Post - The Struggle is Real</a> </h1>

		<div class="post-content"><p>Hey, welcome to my blog. I struggled way more than I should have in creating this, but thanks to Google [and my roommate Jason], I guess I figured it out. Here&rsquo;s a little bit about myself. I&rsquo;m originally from Vancouver, Canada; my family moved to Irvine, California when I was 13. My main sport growing up was water polo but I currently enjoy playing basketball and beer die. Back home you can probably catch me by the beach munching on ahi tuna poke with a Modelo by my side. Sports wise I like the Lakers [basketball], Bayern Munich [real football], and the Montr√©al Canadiens (hockey). My favorite musicians are Kanye West, Frank Ocean and Playboi Carti. Favorite bands are Tame Impala, Nirvana and Black Sabbath. Currently a Neuroscience &amp; Cognitive Science student at the University of Arizona, hoping to find a job in neurotech after I pursue a master&rsquo;s degree. I decided to do iX this summer because I find machine learning intriguing and wanted to learn some new skills this summer. Below is my LinkedIn, my profile picture is from 4 years ago so I&rsquo;m gonna have to take a new one sometime during my stay in Lisbon. Check out my social media, I promise you won&rsquo;t be disappointed :) Thanks for stopping by.</p>
